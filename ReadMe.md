# Leveraging spiking deep neural networks to model neural mechanisms underlying selective attention
### by Lynn K.A. Sörensen, Davide Zambrano, Heleen A. Slagter, Sander M. Bohté, & H.Steven Scholte

This is the code that accompagnies the [paper](link) and consists of two parts, the `asn` package for DCNN to sDCNN conversion with and without spatial attention and the code used to reproduce the results preasented in the paper (`ModelTraining`, `ModelEvaluation`, `ModelAnalysis`)

The `asn` package relies on Keras with a TensorFlow backend. More details can be found there.

For the analysis part, results files can be downloaded [here](link) to follow these analyses. 
Please make sure to add the right files to the `ModelEvaluation` and `ModelAnalysis` folder to reproduce the `Figures`.

The model training scripts can be found in `ModelTraining`. The resulting weights are provided [here](link).
